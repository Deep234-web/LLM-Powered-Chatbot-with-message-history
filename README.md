# LLM-Powered Chatbot

This project demonstrates how to design and implement a chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). The chatbot is able to have interactive conversations, remember previous interactions, and respond in different languages using Langchain and Groq API.

## Features

- **Conversation Memory**: The chatbot can remember past interactions based on session history.
- **Customizable Responses**: You can modify the language and structure of responses.
- **Message Trimming**: Limits the number of tokens in a conversation, preserving essential parts.
- **Session Handling**: Each session has its own chat history, allowing personalized interactions.
- **Model Integration**: Utilizes Groq API for model invocation using Langchain.
